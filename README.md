# Exercise-Tracker-MERN-APP

Welcome to my **Exercise Tracker Application** I've built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack!

## About the Project

The Exercise Tracker Application is a web-based solution designed to help users track their exercise routines. It allows users to log their exercise.

## Key Features

- User authentication and registration.
- Exercise logging with details like exercise type, duration, description and date.

## Technologies Used

This application was built using modern web development technologies:

- React for building the user interface.
- React Router for handling navigation.
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend server.
- MongoDB for data storage.
- Bootstrap & CSS for styling.
- JWT for authentication.

## Future Enhancements

I'm continually working to improve the application and plan to add new features in the future, such as:

- Integration with fitness wearables and APIs.
- Social sharing capabilities.
- Personalized workout plans generated by AI.
